<h1>About Our Founder:
</h1>
<p>Nitte Vinaya Hegde can be described as an entrepreneur having made
a successful foray into the field of education, a philanthropist, a
technocrat, an avid sports lover, a family man and finally to describe in his
own words a true human being. He towers over many others when it comes to his
contribution in heralding the second renaissance in the field of education in
undivided Dakshina Kannada district. Under the guidance of this great
visionary, Nitte Education Trust (NET) run by him has emerged as the largest
Mangalore-based educational institution catering to basic and professional
education. Being the son of a famous father late justice K S Hegde, Former

Judge of the Supreme Court of India and Speaker of Lok Sabha, was not a
deterrent for him to carve out his own place of eminence. </p>
